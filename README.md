# FilmFlix-Database

## An interactive console which allows CRUD operations to be performed on a films database 

This is a full stack project in Python which allows the user to interact with an integrated Python IDE (https://replit.com/) and perform CRUD operations on the database.
The database contains information about films, such as name, release date, genre and rating.

## How to install and run project

* Clone this repository
* Simply run the index.html file in the root directory

## How it works:

* Python is used as the backend with this project, with each CRUD operation written into separate python files and imported into main.py
* SQLite module is used to allow Python to connect and iterate through the films database
* Replit is used to allow the user to interact with the database and execute the CRUD operations
